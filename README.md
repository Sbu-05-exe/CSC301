Emily here:
Out of the 16 things to do, we still have:
- responsive sidebar, slide down a bar, finish drop-down menu
- Have at least 2 different responsive design features (got at least 1 though)
- Finish commenting layouts for other pages - mainly normal flow
- Check we have 20 different CSS attributes (seems likely though)
- What are CSS list links? We need 3 of those, format tables, format forms
- Media queries
