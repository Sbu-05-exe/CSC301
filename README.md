# CSC301" 


Website I took inspiration from

* [fodor](https://www.fodors.com/)
* [superbalist](https://superbalist.com/)
* [lonenlyplanet](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/)
* [localeur] (https://www.localeur.com/)
* [travelandleisure] (https://www.travelandleisureco.com/us/en)


### Backlog
- [x] add a reviews page
- [ ] add a profile page (must display the information of a user and let them be able to update and change their information including adding a display photo)
- [ ] style the profile page (Sibu will take care of styling)
- [ ] write php for processing login page (I left comments to help anyone who wants to tackle it in the processLogin.php file)
- [ ] populate attractions table with data (create queries to insert attractions information. TIP: PHP can store JSON objects so we could try write a loop to add all the attractions information to the comments page)
- [ ] style comments and form on reviews page (sibu will take care of this again)

I'll try leave the styling until last because that stuff generally takes me a while. The focus is on getting php and backend related code to work.

### optional features
- [ ] add an admin page to add attractions
- [ ] make attractions page responsive
- [ ] decide on fonts
